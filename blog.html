                    <p class="fw-semibold fs-5"><span class="text-danger">Question:</span> What Is The Difference Between Local Storage And Session Storage?</p>
                    <p class="fw-semibold"><span class="text-danger">Ans:</span> The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time </p>

                    <p class="fw-semibold"><span class="text-danger">Ans:</span><br> <span class="text-danger">Global Scope:</span> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br> 
                    <span class="text-danger">Block Scope:</span>
                    The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

                    <p class="fw-semibold"><span class="text-danger">Ans:</span>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                    <p class="fw-semibold"><span class="text-danger">Ans:</span>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
